## Key Findings & Insights

### 1. Temporal Purchase Patterns

  The most notable peak occurs in **November (Black Friday sales)**.  
- **Weekend Shopping**: About **25% of customers** shop exclusively on weekends.  
- **Discount-Driven Buyers**: Around **15% of customers** only purchase when items are on sale.

### 2. Geographic Distribution
- Identified the **regions and states with the highest concentration of orders** → useful for localized marketing and logistics optimization.  
- **Total customer base in the dataset: 43,713.**

### 3. Product Category Preferences
- The **“Bed Bath Table”** category is the **most sold product category**, indicating a strong customer interest.  
- Suggests a potential **focus for inventory planning and marketing campaigns**.

### 4. Behavioral Segmentation
- **Purchase Behavior**: Segmented customers based on purchase timing (weekday vs. weekend), discount usage, and order frequency.  
- **Satisfaction Drivers**: Review analysis shows key issues:  
  - **Late deliveries**  
  - **Incorrect items**  
  - **Product quality concerns**  

Addressing these is **crucial for customer satisfaction and loyalty**.

### 5. RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- **Recency**: How recently a customer purchased.  
- **Frequency**: How often they purchase.  
- **Monetary Value**: How much they spend.  

**Key Insight**: Most customers made **only a single purchase in 2017**, making it difficult to identify strong loyal segments.  
Signals of repeat purchase behavior are still **weak**.

3. **Prioritize operational improvements**:
