Olist Customer Segmentation Analysis (2017)
Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Olist's customer base for the year 2017. The goal was to better understand customer purchasing behavior to inform and improve the company's strategic decisions. The analysis delves into when customers shop, what they buy, and where they are located, utilizing key segmentation models like RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and behavioral analysis.

Key Findings & Insights
1. Temporal Purchase Patterns
Seasonal Peaks: Customer activity significantly increases during seasonal events and sales periods. The most notable peak occurs in November, directly correlated with Black Friday sales.

Weekend Shopping: A distinct segment of customers (approximately 25%) shop exclusively on weekends and show no purchasing activity on weekdays or outside of promotional seasons.

Discount-Driven Buyers: A significant portion of customers (15%) are highly sensitive to discounts, making purchases only when items are on sale.

2. Geographic Distribution
The analysis identified the regions and states with the highest concentration of orders, providing clear targets for localized marketing and logistics optimization.

Total customer base in the dataset: 43,713.

3. Product Category Preferences
The "Bed Bath Table" category was identified as the most sold product category, indicating a key area of customer interest and a potential focus for inventory and marketing.

4. Behavioral Segmentation
Purchase Behavior: Segmented customers based on their purchase timing (weekday vs. weekend), discount usage, and order frequency.

Satisfaction Drivers: Review analysis highlighted critical areas for improvement: late deliveries, incorrect items, and product quality. Addressing these is crucial for increasing customer satisfaction and fostering loyalty.

5. RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase.

Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase.

Monetary Value: How much money a customer spends.

Key Insight: The 2017 data reveals that the vast majority of customers made only a single purchase, making it difficult to reliably identify a loyal customer segment at this time. The signals for repeat purchasing behavior are still weak.

Conclusion
The analysis reveals that Olist's customer base is highly influenced by promotions and timing. To build a more loyal customer base beyond one-time purchasers, the company should:

Leverage seasonal campaigns (like Black Friday) to acquire new customers.

Develop targeted strategies for distinct segments (e.g., weekend-only shoppers and discount-driven buyers).

Prioritize operational improvements in delivery accuracy, order correctness, and product quality to address the primary causes of customer dissatisfaction noted in reviews.

Improving the customer experience in these key areas is expected to increase satisfaction, encourage repeat purchases, and make loyal customer patterns more identifiable in the future.
